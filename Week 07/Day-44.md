# ðŸ“… Day 44 - July 22, 2025

## âœ… What I Worked On
- Implemented restriction on **AutoDialer module** for Guest Users
- Ensured guest users cannot access or trigger AutoDialer functionality

## ðŸ§  What I Learned
- Fine-grained permission handling for specific modules
- How to enforce access restrictions at both **UI and backend levels**

## ðŸ§© Challenges I Faced
- Needed to ensure that guest restrictions donâ€™t affect normal registered users
- Handling conditional rendering of UI components based on role

## ðŸ”§ How I Solved / Plan to Solve It
- Added role-based access control (RBAC) check for `org_name` and `user_type`
- Updated UI to disable/grey out AutoDialer option for Guest Users

## ðŸ“š Resources I Used
- RBAC implementation examples
- Documentation on middleware for access restriction

## ðŸ’¬ Notes / Observations
- Guest restrictions working as expected for AutoDialer  
- Next step: Apply similar restrictions to other sensitive modules
