# ðŸ“… Day 46 - July 24, 2025

## âœ… What I Worked On
- Almost wrapped up **Guest User restrictions** across all modules  
- Finalized checks in **AutoDialer, Email, and Campaign Setup**  
- Added missing validations to ensure Guest Users canâ€™t bypass limits

## ðŸ§  What I Learned
- Importance of consistency when applying role-based access restrictions  
- How one missing check in backend APIs can leave security gaps  

## ðŸ§© Challenges I Faced
- Some edge cases where Guest Users could still see restricted UI elements  
- Needed to sync both **frontend (UI)** and **backend (API)** enforcement  

## ðŸ”§ How I Solved / Plan to Solve It
- Cleaned up conditional rendering in React components  
- Standardized middleware for Guest User checks across APIs  
- Planning final round of testing before declaring restrictions complete  

## ðŸ“š Resources I Used
- RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) best practices  
- React conditional rendering patterns  

## ðŸ’¬ Notes / Observations
- Guest User restriction is **95% complete**  
- Next step: final testing + documentation of the restriction rules
