# ðŸ“… Day 53 - July 31, 2025

## âœ… What I Worked On
- Worked across the **whole app** to polish functionality  
- Finalized and tested **Guest User implementation**  
- Ensured all restrictions and flows worked smoothly  
- Prepared the system for **tomorrowâ€™s demo**  

## ðŸ§  What I Learned
- Importance of thorough end-to-end testing before a demo  
- Guest User flows require careful handling to avoid accidental access  

## ðŸ§© Challenges I Faced
- Minor inconsistencies between Guest and Registered user permissions  
- Ensuring Guest restrictions didnâ€™t break normal user workflows  

## ðŸ”§ How I Solved / Plan to Solve It
- Ran multiple user role simulations  
- Fixed edge cases in restrictions (Autodialer, Email, etc.)  
- Coordinated with UI updates to maintain consistency  

## ðŸ“š Resources I Used
- Internal app documentation for role-based access  
- Debugging tools to simulate guest vs. registered usage  

## ðŸ’¬ Notes / Observations
- Guest User flow is now **fully ready**  
- Confident for tomorrowâ€™s **demo presentation**
