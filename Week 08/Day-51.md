# ðŸ“… Day 51 - July 29, 2025

## âœ… What I Worked On
- Continued refining the **UI** of the app  
- Worked on **performance improvements** for smoother navigation and faster load times  

## ðŸ§  What I Learned
- Even minor UI tweaks can impact performance (e.g., heavy components, unnecessary re-renders)  
- Techniques for optimizing React/Tailwind components  

## ðŸ§© Challenges I Faced
- Some pages were taking longer to load due to multiple API calls  
- UI responsiveness issues on certain screen sizes  

## ðŸ”§ How I Solved / Plan to Solve It
- Reduced redundant API calls by optimizing data fetching  
- Improved responsiveness with better use of flex/grid layouts  
- Plan to test performance across different browsers  

## ðŸ“š Resources I Used
- React optimization documentation  
- Chrome DevTools (for performance profiling)  

## ðŸ’¬ Notes / Observations
- App is now faster and more responsive  
- Still scope for further performance optimization
