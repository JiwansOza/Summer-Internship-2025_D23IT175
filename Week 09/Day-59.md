# ðŸ“… Day 59 â€“ August 6, 2025  

## âœ… What I Worked On  
- Started working on the **backend for the Product Owner Page**  
- Set up **API endpoints** to handle product owner data  
- Integrated with **database models** for storing and retrieving details  

## ðŸ§  What I Learned  
- Better understanding of **structuring backend logic** for role-specific pages  
- How to manage **separation of concerns** between admin, user, and product owner roles  

## ðŸ§© Challenges I Faced  
- Designing APIs that are **scalable** and easy to maintain  
- Handling **role-based access control (RBAC)** correctly  

## ðŸ”§ How I Solved / Plan to Solve It  
- Broke down the backend tasks into **modular services**  
- Used **middleware for authentication and role verification**  
- Tested endpoints using **Postman** before integration  

## ðŸ“š Resources I Used  
- Official **Express.js / Node.js docs**  
- Database schema diagrams from earlier work  
- StackOverflow for clarifying role-based access handling  

## ðŸ’¬ Notes / Observations  
- The backend for the **Product Owner Page** is in progress   
- Next focus: **linking backend APIs with frontend UI** for smooth functionality
