# ðŸ“… Day 37 - July 15, 2025

## âœ… What I Worked On
- Completed **AutoDialer module enhancement** with `org_name` and user-based data control
- Implemented logic to ensure **autodialer data is scoped per organization and user**
- Updated APIs and UI components to reflect proper access control and visibility

## ðŸ§  What I Learned
- Gained deeper understanding of **data isolation techniques** in shared infrastructure
- Improved backend filtering and **role-based access logic**

## ðŸ§© Challenges I Faced
- Handling edge cases where legacy data didn't contain `org_name` or had mismatched users
- Updating nested API calls and ensuring consistency across modules

## ðŸ”§ How I Solved / Plan to Solve It
- Wrote migration scripts to update legacy data with correct `org_name` references
- Used session-based validation and applied context-aware filters in backend

## ðŸ“š Resources I Used
- Existing org-based campaign logic as reference
- API documentation and previous auth handling patterns

## ðŸ’¬ Notes / Observations
- AutoDialer is now fully **organization- and user-aware**, aligned with multi-tenancy goals  
- Next step: perform regression testing and integrate with campaign reports
