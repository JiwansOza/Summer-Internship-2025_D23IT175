# ðŸ“… Day 36 - July 14, 2025

## âœ… What I Worked On
- Started implementation of **organization-based data segregation** using `org_name`
- Designed logic to ensure **only data belonging to the same organization** is visible and accessible
- Modified backend query structure and model filters to support multi-organization data handling

## ðŸ§  What I Learned
- Understood the importance of **multi-tenancy architecture** in scalable applications
- Learned how to **filter data dynamically** based on organization-specific context

## ðŸ§© Challenges I Faced
- Mapping existing user data with their respective organizations without breaking old logic
- Ensuring backwards compatibility with current API routes and front-end state handling

## ðŸ”§ How I Solved / Plan to Solve It
- Introduced middleware checks for `org_name` and adjusted schema relationships
- Planning to audit and patch all dependent modules (campaigns, reports) for org-level data control

## ðŸ“š Resources I Used
- Internal documentation on user-org mapping
- Stack Overflow threads on multi-tenant architecture patterns in Node.js

## ðŸ’¬ Notes / Observations
- This step is critical for making the system secure, modular, and enterprise-ready  
- Will continue tomorrow by extending org-based filtering to the remaining modules
