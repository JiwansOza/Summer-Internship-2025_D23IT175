# ðŸ“… Day 08 - June 16, 2025

## âœ… What I Worked On
- Implemented **bulk call functionality** in the Auto Dialer module
- Worked on selecting and triggering calls to multiple contacts at once

## ðŸ§  What I Learned
- Gained understanding of handling batch operations and looping through contact lists
- Improved knowledge of front-end to back-end interaction for call triggers

## ðŸ§© Challenges I Faced
- Needed to ensure proper delay and sequence when triggering multiple calls

## ðŸ”§ How I Solved / Plan to Solve It
- Used batching logic and basic throttling to manage multiple call events

## ðŸ“š Resources I Used
- Auto Dialer component references
- JavaScript async handling guides

## ðŸ’¬ Notes / Observations
- Bulk calling can significantly improve outreach but needs strict control to avoid overload
- Testing for edge cases is essential before full integration
