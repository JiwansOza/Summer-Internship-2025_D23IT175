# ðŸ“… Day 67 â€“ August 14, 2025  

## âœ… What I Worked On  
- Started working on **performance enhancement** for the application  
- Focused on identifying **slow-loading components and APIs**  

## ðŸ§  What I Learned  
- Performance optimization requires a mix of **frontend and backend tuning**  
- Even small inefficiencies (extra re-renders, unoptimized queries) can slow down the system  

## ðŸ§© Challenges I Faced  
- Pinpointing the exact **bottlenecks** in the system  
- Some optimizations caused temporary UI glitches  

## ðŸ”§ How I Solved / Plan to Solve It  
- Used **profiling tools** to track API and rendering performance  
- Planning to implement **caching & code-splitting** for heavy components  

## ðŸ“š Resources I Used  
- Chrome DevTools Performance Profiler  
- Lighthouse for page speed insights  

## ðŸ’¬ Notes / Observations  
- Performance work is an **ongoing process**  
- Next goal: optimize API response times and frontend rendering speed ðŸš€
