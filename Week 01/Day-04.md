# ðŸ“… Day 04 - June 12, 2025

## âœ… What I Worked On
- Worked on the **"Add Contact"** functionality for the Auto Dialer
- Integrated the calling feature â€“ calls are now being triggered
- Designed and improved the **UI for Follow-up** tab

## ðŸ§  What I Learned
- Understood the flow of adding dynamic contact data for automated calling
- Improved skills in connecting UI interactions with backend actions

## ðŸ§© Challenges I Faced
- Call is going through, but thereâ€™s a functional issue during the call

## ðŸ”§ How I Solved / Plan to Solve It
- Will debug the in-call issue by inspecting backend response and logs tomorrow
- Planning to test with dummy data to replicate the problem

## ðŸ“š Resources I Used
- Upreach project (`abhi` branch and references from `vis-name`)
- Team feedback and testing inputs

## ðŸ’¬ Notes / Observations
- Calling integration is progressing well; only minor debugging left
- UI of follow-up tab aligns with existing project design
