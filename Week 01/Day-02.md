# ðŸ“… Day 02 - June 10, 2025

## âœ… What I Worked On
- Assigned to implement the **Auto Dialer and Task Automation** feature for the Upreach project.
- Started working on the basic UI layout and structure for:
  - Auto dialer section
  - Follow-up section based on interaction status
- Explored the logic behind automated calling and task scheduling (based on interaction types like call/SMS/email).
- Also reviewed Git basics and began exploring Docker fundamentals as instructed.

## ðŸ§  What I Learned
- Understood how automated communication tools help in sales processes.
- Got an overview of how features are broken down into **user stories** and implemented accordingly.
- Learned how follow-ups can be automated based on interaction history (status-driven logic).

## ðŸ“‹ User Stories Assigned
### ðŸ”¹ User Story 4.1
> As a sales representative, I want an auto dialer to call a list of leads automatically so that I can maximize my outreach.

### ðŸ”¹ User Story 4.2
> As a sales representative, I want to automate follow-up messages based on client interaction status so that I can focus on closing deals.

### ðŸ”¹ User Story 4.3
> As a sales representative, I want the platform to log all interactions (calls, SMS, emails) automatically so that I can track communication history.

## ðŸ§© Challenges I Faced
- Was new to Docker and didn't fully grasp containerization yet
- Needed better clarity on how automated logging is to be implemented

## ðŸ”§ How I Solved / Plan to Solve It
- Planned to revisit Docker documentation and go through video tutorials
- Will discuss the exact requirements of the logging mechanism with mentors

## ðŸ“š Resources I Used
- Company project (Upreach) codebase and issue tracker
- YouTube tutorials and Docker documentation (beginner-level)
- Git cheat sheet for revision

## ðŸ’¬ Notes / Observations
- This feature impacts real-time user interaction, so testing and performance optimization will be important
- Tomorrow, Iâ€™ll continue developing the frontend and explore backend logic for the auto dialer
