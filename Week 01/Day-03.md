# ðŸ“… Day 03 - June 11, 2025

## âœ… What I Worked On
- Explored the `vis-name` branch where a previous version of the Auto Dialer and Follow-up feature was implemented.
- Reviewed the code structure and logic used earlier for reference.
- Started implementing the **Auto Dialer** functionality based on that reference.
- Began building the **Follow-up tab** interface and functionality.

## ðŸ§  What I Learned
- How to reuse and improve existing code
- Gained better understanding of the feature's flow and purpose
- Learned how modular components were reused in the earlier version

## ðŸ§© Challenges I Faced
- Understanding the older logic and adapting it to current requirements

## ðŸ”§ How I Solved / Plan to Solve It
- Carefully compared both branches (`abhi` and `vis-name`)
- Reused some UI and handler logic from the `vis-name` branch
- Will continue to enhance and integrate both tabs tomorrow

## ðŸ“š Resources I Used
- `vis-name` branch of the Upreach project
- Internal team discussions and past code references

## ðŸ’¬ Notes / Observations
- Referring to previously built code helped speed up implementation
- Coordination with previous developers (if possible) could clarify logic better
