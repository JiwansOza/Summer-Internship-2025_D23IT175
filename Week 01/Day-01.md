# ðŸ“… Day 01 - June 9, 2025

## âœ… What I Worked On
- Received access to the internal repository: [`infowaydevteam/Upreach`](https://github.com/infowaydevteam/Upreach) (branch: `abhi`)
- Cloned the project to my local machine
- Installed required dependencies using `npm install`
- Set up the development environment and ensured the project runs without errors
- Began exploring the codebase to understand folder structure and core functionality

## ðŸ§  What I Learned
- Understood the typical project setup process in a real-world React + Node environment
- Learned about how the team organizes code and uses version control with Git
- Got a basic overview of project components and routing

## ðŸ§© Challenges I Faced
- Faced a minor issue with Node version compatibility

## ðŸ”§ How I Solved / Plan to Solve It
- Installed and used `nvm` to switch to the correct Node.js version
- Verified `.env` settings and checked for any missing keys

## ðŸ“š Resources I Used
- [Upreach GitHub Repo - Branch: abhi](https://github.com/infowaydevteam/Upreach/tree/abhi)
- Internal documentation and project README
- [nvm GitHub Repository](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)

## ðŸ’¬ Notes / Observations
- The project uses Git for version control and follows a feature branch workflow
- Tomorrow, Iâ€™ll dive deeper into understanding component interactions and API flow
