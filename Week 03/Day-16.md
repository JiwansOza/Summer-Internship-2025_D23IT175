# ðŸ“… Day 16 - June 24, 2025

## âœ… What I Worked On
- Completed the implementation of the **bulk call functionality** in the auto dialer module
- Finalized logic for parallel call execution and tested end-to-end flow
- Ensured stability and performance with appropriate handling of call sequences

## ðŸ§  What I Learned
- Understood practical application of async operations in real-time scenarios
- Improved testing and debugging techniques for communication features

## ðŸ§© Challenges I Faced
- Minor issues in handling call state and managing async flow under load

## ðŸ”§ How I Solved / Plan to Solve It
- Added delay handling, error catching, and response validation to make the system more robust

## ðŸ“š Resources I Used
- JavaScript async utilities and console logging
- Project-specific call handler logic

## ðŸ’¬ Notes / Observations
- Bulk call feature is now complete and ready for integration or further QA
