# ðŸ“… Day 15 - June 23, 2025

## âœ… What I Worked On
- Worked on implementing **parallel execution logic** for bulk calling
- Improved the existing bulk call flow to handle multiple calls more efficiently and concurrently

## ðŸ§  What I Learned
- Gained understanding of how to manage parallel operations and asynchronous execution
- Explored strategies to prevent call overlap or overload during high-volume execution

## ðŸ§© Challenges I Faced
- Needed to manage call timing and ensure backend stability during parallel processing

## ðŸ”§ How I Solved / Plan to Solve It
- Used asynchronous patterns to handle calls and added checks to control flow
- Plan to optimize further with load-based throttling if required

## ðŸ“š Resources I Used
- JavaScript async/await and Promise handling documentation
- Existing bulk call logic for reference

## ðŸ’¬ Notes / Observations
- Parallel processing improves performance but needs careful handling to avoid API flooding or system errors
